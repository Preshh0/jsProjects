# jsProjects
A list of assignments i'd get from my tutor as I attempt to learn node.

In this repository, there would be some answers to my assignments as a Javascript learner. 

### Here's a list:

**Array LookUp**: This project makes use of the for loop to access an array and validate whether the information being looked for is contained in it or not. 

**A Node Farm**: This project involves me making use of the previous knowledge in the tutorial - Creating a server, building a simple API, linking templates, - to build a site where i list a bunch of products with their pricing, quantity and group them into organic or inorganics.
